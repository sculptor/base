h1. Sculptor Port of [DDD Sample|http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/]

This page describes a port of the [DDD Sample|http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/] using Sculptor. It is a domain model based on the cargo example used in [Eric Evans' book|http://www.domaindrivendesign.org/books/index.html#DDD].

Sculptor will help you with the static structure of the application. It can  generate the data part of the domain objects and boilerplate code for services and repositories. It has a nice runtime framework for especially the persistence implementations, such as standard queries. However, to qualify as a true DDD application the domain objects must have complex behavior - business logic. With this sample we illustrate how to integrate manually written logic with the automatically generated parts.

h2. Model

The definition of the domain model, using Sculptor's textual DSL is separated in one file for each Module, plus one "empty" top file, which imports the other files.

ApplicationPart CargoPart {
    
    Module cargo {
        "A Cargo. This is the central class in the domain model,
        and it is the root of the Cargo-Itinerary-Leg-DeliveryHistory aggregate.

        A cargo is identified by a unique tracking id, and it always has an origin
        and a destination. The life cycle of a cargo begins with the booking procedure,
        when the tracking id is assigned. During a (short) period of time, between booking
        and initial routing, the cargo has no itinerary.

        The booking clerk requests a list of possible routes, matching a route specification,
        and assigns the cargo to one route. An itinerary listing the legs of the route
        is attached to the cargo.

        A cargo can be re-routed during transport, on demand of the customer, in which case
        the destination is changed and a new route is requested. The old itinerary,
        being a value object, is discarded and a new one is attached.

        It may also happen that a cargo is accidentally misrouted, which should notify the proper
        personnel and also trigger a re-routing procedure.

        The life cycle of a cargo ends when the cargo is claimed by the customer.

        The cargo aggregate, and the entre domain model, is built to solve the problem
        of booking and tracking cargo. All important business rules for determining whether
        or not a cargo is misrouted, what the current status of the cargo is (on board carrier,
        in port etc), are captured in this aggregate."

The generated vizualization with [graphviz|http://www.graphviz.org/] looks like this:
!dddsample-model.png|width=800!

h2. JUnit Tests
This sample has an extensive test suite, which illustrates how to write junit tests at different levels.
- logic in the domain objects is tested with ordinary junit tests, without any need for database emulation or spring container
- repositories and details of the persistence are tested with DBUnit tests and spring container and hibernate using in memory database
- services are tested in a similar way as the repositories, but also using easymock framework

h2. Metrics

It is interesting to compare the fully hand written original [DDD Sample|http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/] with this partly generated port. The number of hand written lines of code in the Sculptor port is 783. Compared to 1179 in the original. The business logic is almost identical, but the Sculptor variant has less lines of code since much of the boring boilerplate code is generated. It has bean measured with [JavaNCSS|http://www.kclee.de/clemens/java/javancss/].

JUnit tests are not included, since they are very similar. Web application is not included, since it is not implemented in this Sculptor port.

h2. Try It

If you are only interested in a sneak preview of the source code you can download it here: [^Sculptor-DDDSample-src.zip]

Another choice is to try the real thing: 

1. Install Sculptor and its requisites as described in the [Installation Guide|1. Installation Guide (CSC)].

2. Checkout the source code from Subversion: [https://fornax.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fornax/trunk/cartridges/sculptor/DDDSample]

3. Build with {{mvn clean install}}. This will also run all JUnit tests located in {{src/test/java}}. Take a look at some of them and run them from Eclipse also.

4. Study the {{.btdesign}} files located in {{src/main/resources}}.

5. Study the hand written code in {{src/main/java}} and the generated code in {{src/generated/java}}.

Learn more about the capabilities of Sculptor by reading the [Hello World|2. Hello World Tutorial (CSC)] and [Advanced Tutorial|3. Advanced Tutorial (CSC)]
